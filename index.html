		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>My name is Serik and I'm a caffeine dependent music producer living in Brooklyn. My music has received support from some of the biggest DJ's in the world like Above & Beyond, Dash Berlin, Tiesto, Guetta, Myon & Shane 54 and so many more.</p>

		<p>But that didn't happen overnight - I've been working hard at this whole music thing for a long time. So long, in fact, that when I say I've also signed originals and remixes to mega-labels like Ultra, Armada, Universal, Sony, Island Def Jam, Virgin, EMI, etc. it just feels like an absolute DREAM come true.</p>

		<p>I've even had the amazing and humbling privilege to work as a mixing and mastering engineer for some of the major labels like Universal, Island Def Jam, & Atlantic.</p>

		<p>But enough with the accolades - I'm just a down to earth guy who loves working with passionate, like-minded producers who are ready to change the world with their music.</p>

		<p>If that sounds like you, I can't stress enough how much I would love for you to join this class.</p>

		<h2>FAQ</h2>
			<a href="#" class="faq-each">
				<h3>1. Do you accept payment plans?<img src="images/plus.png" alt=""></h3>
				<p class="answer">Yes, I accept all major credit cards and can accomdate a weekly payment plan. Hit any registration button on this site to see your options.</p>
			</a>
			<a href="#" class="faq-each">
				<h3>2. How much prior experience do I need to take this course?<img src="images/plus.png" alt=""></h3>
				<p class="answer">If you are an absolute beginner and have never opened a DAW before (or even know what a DAW is) this course is most likely not for you. However, anyone who has spent some time in Logic Pro, Ableton, FL Studio, Reason, Cubase etc. making music will gain a ton of value from this masterclass. </p>
			</a>
			<a href="#" class="faq-each">
				<h3>3. Does it matter what Digital Audio Workstation I use?<img src="images/plus.png" alt=""></h3>
				<p class="answer">The content of this course is not DAW specific. I will primarily be using Logic X, but most of the ideas discussed in the class will be applicable to any DAW on the market. Typical breakdown of students in the past has roughly been 40% Logic, 40% Ableton, & 20% FL Studio</p>
			</a>
			<a href="#" class="faq-each">
				<h3>4. What happens if I miss a class?<img src="images/plus.png" alt=""></h3>
				<p class="answer">All classes will be recorded and available for download after each session. If you have additional questions about the content after missing a class, I will make myself available to you and answer your questions.</p>
			</a>
			<a href="#" class="faq-each">
				<h3>5. I am thinking about taking a class elsewhere. Why should I take this class instead?<img src="images/plus.png" alt=""></h3>
				<p class="answer">I will never discredit other courses when it comes to music production. Each company provides a different experience that may be a better fit for your style. In fact, I took a mixing and mastering class with Dubspot and man, did I learn a lot. That said, I have a unique perspective on the industry because I am an artist first, and a teacher second. In my opinion, this has allowed me to acquire some fairly unique insights and techniques in the production realm that similar learning institutions simply will not be able to provide.</p>
			</a>
			<a href="#" class="faq-each">
				<h3>6. Do you offer any extra 1 on 1 learning sessions?<img src="images/plus.png" alt=""></h3>
				<p class="answer">The Masterclass includes a 1 on 1 session where we actually dig directly into your music. So while I have spent a considerable amount of time working with producers 1 on 1, I simply can't keep up with the demand. In rare cases, I may have a few openings, but this masterclass is really the best way to get my insights and to advance your production quality at the present time.</p>
			</a>
			<a href="#" class="faq-each">
				<h3>7. Do you offer mixing and mastering services?<img src="images/plus.png" alt=""></h3>
				<p class="answer">Yes, head over to <a href="http://www.hyperbitsmusic.com" target="_blank">www.hyperbitsmusic.com</a> to see what services I can provide for your music.</p>
			</a>
			<a href="#" class="faq-each">
				<h3>8. How often do you offer this course? How can I find out about a future Masterclass?<img src="images/plus.png" alt=""></h3>
				<p class="answer">My current plan is to run the class 2, maybe 3 times max per year. If you want to be first in line for a future Masterclass, or just want a reminder when the class is running again,  <a href="https://hyperbits.wufoo.com/forms/hyperbits-5-week-masterclass-2015/" target="_blank">fill out this form</a> and I will be in touch.</p>
